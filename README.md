# attendance-system
A Python-based attendance system that leverages OpenCV and face_recognition to detect and log faces in real time. The app records attendance with unique, timestamped CSV logs, captures and saves images of mismatched faces, and automatically exits based on detection timing. Ideal for lightweight, secure attendance management.
