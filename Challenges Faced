Challenges Faced

During development, several challenges were encountered:

    Compatibility Issues:
    Python 3.13 caused compatibility issues with dlib and face_recognition. After discussions and testing, it was determined that using Python 3.10 or 3.11 provided a more stable environment.
    Exit Mechanism:
    Implementing a reliable exit strategy was challenging. The program now exits 5 seconds after a face is detected or 10 seconds if no face is detected, with an option for manual exit via 'q'.
    Log File Naming:
    Windows does not allow certain characters (like colons or asterisks) in file names. The log file naming was refined to use underscores and hyphens to format date and time correctly.
    Mismatch Handling:
    Capturing a mismatched face and saving it separately, then logging the event with a brief description, required careful coordination between face detection and file operations.
    Security Considerations:
    Determining whether a face matched a known individual or not, and logging mismatches for further review, added additional complexity.
